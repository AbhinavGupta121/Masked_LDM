188: 
both losses with mask_weight = 1, ddpm_mask_thresh= 350

191: 
only perceptual loss, no ddpm_mask_thresh

212: 
loss = (1-mask_weight)*sd_loss + mask_weight*mask Loss, where mask_weight= 0.7
image size increased to 512x(lesser) same aspect ratio
ddpm_mask_thresh = 200

215:
Baseline run with 512xlesser image size

216: 
Baseline run with 512x 512 image size

217:
same as 212 but image size increased to 512x512
